# Sort-Files
When I have TV series or any numbered files but the number of each file is not in the beginning of the file name! then I can't order them by name in file explorer; files order will be mess. So, this simple program will detect any number in file name then will change the name of the file by insert that number in the beginning of the file name. So, I can order it by name in file explorer and get the correct order!
