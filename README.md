# Sort-Files
When I have TV series or any numbered files but number are not in the beginning of files name then I can't order them by name. files order will be mess, because of that. So, this simple program will detect any number in files then will change the name of the file by insert that number in the beginning of the file name. So, I can order it by name file explorer and get the correct order!
